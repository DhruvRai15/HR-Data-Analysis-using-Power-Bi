   - Use conditional formatting and color coding to highlight critical insights and trends.
   - Incorporate interactive elements like tooltips, hover effects, and drill-through actions for detailed analysis.

6. **Insights and Analysis:**
   - Analyze the visualized data to identify patterns and correlations.
   - Provide insights into high-risk areas, such as departments with high attrition rates or specific job roles with frequent turnover.
   - Suggest actionable recommendations based on the analysis to improve employee retention.

7. **Dashboard Testing and Validation:**
